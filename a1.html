<h2 style="font-family:Gungsuh;color:white;font-size:20px;">Why Web Standards is important o various stakeholders?<h2/>

To make internet a better place, for both developers and visitors, it is important that both browsers and Web developers follow the Web standards.

When developers follow the Web standards, the development is simplified, since it is easier for a developer to understand another's coding.

Using Web standards will ensure that all browsers will display your Web 
site properly, without time-consuming rewrites.

Web pages that conforms to the standard are easier for search engines to access and index, easier to convert to other formats, and easier to access with program code (like JavaScript and the DOM).
<h2 style="font-family:Gungsuh;color:white;font-size:20px;">An example of an important standard and who it affect :508 Law<h2/>

In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Inaccessible technology interferes with an individual's ability to obtain and use information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C. ' 794d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others.
